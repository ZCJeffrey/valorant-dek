        <h2>
            Competitive
        </h2>
    <p>
        Competitive, or ranked, is the most played game mode in Valorant. You are<br>matched against players of similar skill levels. Players compete against each other<br>to climb through the ranks.

The objective in a ranked match is “Plant/Defuse”<br>where you play as an Attacker or a Defender.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Unrated
    </h2>
    <p>
        Unrated is a casual “Plant/Defuse” scenario, the rules and gameplay of an<br>unrated match are the same as those of a competitive match.<br>Winning or losing a game on unrated does not affect your rank.
    </p>
        <h2>Replication</h2>
        <p>This is the game’s best-of-nine mode where all 10 players use the same Agents.<br>The game usually lasts 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
        <h2>
            Spike Rush
        </h2>
        <p>
            Players use the same randomized weapon in their artillery, with buffs and debuffs<br>scattered across the map. This mode lasts around 8 to 12 minutes.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Deathmatch
        </h2>
        <p>
            Deathmatch allows players to practice gunplay mechanics while restricting<br>abilities or their warm-up. The game ends after nine minutes or once a player<br>achieves 40 kills.
