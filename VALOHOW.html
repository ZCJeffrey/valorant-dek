        The aim is to become the first team to win 13 rounds. To accomplish this,<br>players must either eliminate the members of the opposing team<br>or finish the objective assigned to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        For Attackers, this involves planting a spike (or a bomb).<br>They must plant and defend the spike against the opposing team<br>until it successfully goes off. The attacking side receives the point in the round<br>if the spike detonates or the group manages to eliminate the enemy team.

    </p>
    <p>
        The Defenders are tasked to neutralize the bomb as quickly as possible.<br>This involves the players defusing it within a specific time.<br>The group receives the point if this attempt is successful.
